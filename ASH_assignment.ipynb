I tried to resolve the issue by emailing to Micheal but it didnt help since it was hard to explain what the issue was in the email. Micheal worked it out and got rectified in the face to face lecture which was 2 days before the due day of the assignment submission. so I wasnt able to start over and create history again in this limited time. my Appologies on not being able to have all the work flow history in github."
